# Intuition/Unintuitive To-do App

Meant to be used as a presentation demo counterexample to show how an app can be made very unintuitive.

Not really anything special, this was extremely rushed and barely has any functionality.

What is can do:
- Add tasks
- Mark tasks as done
- Toggle dark/light mode
